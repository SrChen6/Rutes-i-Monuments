# Rutes-i-Monuments
Made by: Mart√≠ Gil, Haokang Chen

## Description
These programs are the second task for Algoritmics and Programming II.

The project consists in obtaining information about routes in a certain region that hikers upload to the web to then create a graph of the common paths taken by all of them. Furthermore, there is an option to look for nearby monuments and find the shortest path to get there from a certain location.

The routes are downloaded from [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=12/41.3823/2.1279) and and the monuments are imported from [Catalunya Medieval](https://www.catalunyamedieval.es/).
